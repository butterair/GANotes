## Connection to the Long-Term Goal

Introduction to building iOS Interfaces in Xcode.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

+ **Style** User Interface Elements using Interface Builder
+ **Add** an Image Asset to Xcode
+ **Add** UI Elements to a storyboard
+ **Run** a project on a Simulator
+ **Create** user interfaces in Xcode

### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

+ Identify the different parts of Xcode
+ Create new projects

<!--
### Instructor Prep

+ Take a look at the [lab](https://github.com/ga-iosi-la/iOSI-course-materials-LA/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-01/baseline-materials/single-view-lab)
+ Open the [starter code](https://github.com/ga-iosi-la/iOSI-course-materials-LA/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-01/baseline-materials/single-view-lab/starter-code/SingleViewLab)
-->
### STUDENT GROUND RULES

+ For all Demos, students should have their laptops closed. Attention should be on the instructor.
+ Students can open their laptops for the independent practice sessions.

## OPENING (10 mins)

### DIAGNOSTIC ASK

"How hard do you think it is to create interfaces in iOS?"

### DRAW-PAIR-SHARE

+ Have the students open an App they use often, like Instagram
+ Sketch the UI on Paper
+ Name each element in the interface (image, text, etc)
+ Discuss what you sketched with a partner
+ Discuss with class

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Class Discussion: "What were some of the interface elements you identified?"

---

## INTRODUCTION: INTERFACE BUILDER (10 mins)

### DEFINITION

"The Interface Builder editor within Xcode makes it simple to design a full user interface without writing any code."

+ [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/Xcode/interface-builder/)
+ Show screenshots of Interface Builder, explaining the different parts

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Draw-Compare-Share are activity. Have the students draw Xcode’s Interface builder, naming each of the parts.

## DEMO: ADDING UI ELEMENTS (5 mins)

For this section, students should have their laptops closed.

+ Open up Xcode
+ Demonstrate adding UI Elements
+ Demonstrate adding Images to Xcode

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Draw-Share Activity: Draw what you think Xcode’s layout is like, naming each section.

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (15 mins)

For this section, students practice what they learned by adding UI Elements.

### STUDENT INSTRUCTIONS

+ Open up Xcode
+ Create a new project
+ Open the storyboard

### CHALLENGE

Create a view your favorite quotes.

+ Include the author of the quote in a separate field
+ Include a picture of the author

There should be a total of 4 elements.

---

## INTRODUCTION: RUNNING IN THE SIMULATOR (5 mins)

+ Explain why we need simulators
+ Explain the different types of simulators
+ Explain the shortcomings of simulators

Simulators help us test our apps very quickly.They also allow us to test how things work on a wide range of devices and OS versions.

## DEMO (5 mins)

+ Open or create a project
+ Update the background color to solid primary color.
+ Run the app on an iPhone 7
+ Run the app on an iPhone 7 Plus

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

### CHALLENGE

+ Run your project on 4 different simulators.
+ Make note of the differences you see with each of the different devices
+ Discuss with a partner

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Student prompt: "What did you notice as you were running the apps on different simulators?"

---

## INTRODUCTION: STYLING UI ELEMENTS (5 mins)

### DIAGNOSTIC ASK

"Has anyone done any Web or Android work before? If so, how did you style elements in that system?"

### THINK PAIR SHARE - WHY STYLE?

During this activity, have students discuss the value of style and why it is important. Recall the features of the sketched app that the students didn't like.

Follow that up with a class discussion.

+ Styling is what sets your app apart
+ Styling provides a nice visual experience

## DEMO (5 mins)

Demonstrate:

+ Throw a label on the view
+ Change the font, the color
+ Change the color of the main view’s background
+ Change the display mode of an image (Aspect-Fit/Scale/etc)

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

In this section, students practice what they learned by styling UI Elements.

Activity: 

- Show a view on the screen with styled elements. 
- Have the students recreate that view.

### BONUS

Use a custom font.

## CONCLUSION (10 mins)

CLASSROOM DISCUSSION

How hard was it compared to what you expected?

### TAKEAWAYS

+ Interface Builder is a really intuitive way to put together interfaces
+ It is the recommended way to create interfaces in iOS
+ Interfaces are divided into pages called View Controllers.
