 # ![GA icon](GAIcon.png) Building User Interfaces
 
 Week I DAY II
 
 ## The topics we will cover are:
 
 - Model View Controller (i.e., MVC)
 - `ViewControllers`
 - `UITableViewController`
 - `UINavigationController`
 
 ## By the end of this lesson, we should be able to (i.e., Learning Objectives):
* discuss the Model View Controller design pattern
* differentiate the uses of a scene from a ViewController
* manipulate `ViewControllers`, `UITableViewController`
 & `UINavigationController`
* witness the lifecycle of a view with `print(:)`
 
 ## Connection to long term goal:
Exposes students to the default, built-in navigation paradigm for iOS apps
 
 ## Student prework before we open!
 * Instagram app
 
 
 ## Model View Controller design pattern
 
 ![MVC](MVC.png)
 
 * a design pattern is a common solution to a software problem 
 * ensure that a developer not have to re-invent the wheel for every situation 
 * common vocabulary to discuss high-level ideas with minimal explanation and full understanding
 * Model View Controller pervades iOS; creational (i.e., singleton, abstract factory), structural (i.e., decorator, adapter, facade, composite), behavioral (i.e., observer, memento, chain of responsibility, command)
 * Understanding MVC helps us understand Xcode's description of objects (i.e., views, ViewControllers, etc...), as well as helps you organize your code to create apps that are maintainable, readable, & well-designed
 
 * slide show 
 
 * discuss the Model View Controller design pattern
 
 ## ViewControllers
 
 * differentiate the uses of a scene from a ViewController
 * overview of the document outline, view hierarchy, constraints (programmatic / IB)
 * two types of `ViewControllers` & mention idea of subclass & two
 
 * manipulate `ViewControllers`, `UITableViewController`
 & `UINavigationController`
 
* add `UILabels`, `UIImageView` to `UITableViewController`,
 
 ## Lifecycle of a View & `print(:)`
 
`print(:)` at every stage of the lifecycle of the view; discuss strategies for figuring out where the best place a call to those functions is. Early advantage.

 ## Closing
 
 We covered MVC, ViewControllers, & the Lifecycle of a View. What do you think?
 
 ### Class Discussion
 
 Earlier we said that by the end of this lesson, we should be able to:
 * discuss the Model View Controller design pattern
 * differentiate the uses of a scene from a ViewController
 * manipulate `ViewControllers`, `UITableViewController`
 & `UINavigationController`
 * witness the lifecycle of a view with `print(:)`
 
 ### Takeaways
 
 - What is a MVC? What do the terms `ViewController` or `View` mean in Xcode or Swift?
