 # Swift Strings
 =======================
 
 ## Learning Objectives
 
 * **Articulate** how Strings are stored
 
 * **Manipulate** characters in Strings
 
 * **Parse** words inside of a String
 
 * **Iterate** through characters in a String
 
 ## Connection to long term goal:
 
 Strings is a fundamental type in Swift, a struct but not a class that is used throughout Swift itself as well as iOS application development.
 
 ## Opening (5 - 10 Mins)
 
 What is a String type?
 
 ## Practice Problem
 
 Write a function that takes a number represented as a String and converts it to an Int.

 ## DEFINITION
 
 "A String is a series of characters."
 
 **Syntax**:
 
 `var stringName: Type? = ...`
 ```
 var name: String = "Eric"
 
 ```
 
 ## Introduction: Strings (10 mins)
 
 Strings are important. As constants String types play a key role in iOS development.  A value for `kURL`, for instance, may be an example of how a String type is used to facilitate HTTP requests; A storyboard ID is a String type that you can use to create a new ViewController based on that storyboard's ViewController or for the sake of assigning a class to a scene in Interface Builder we use a String type. Here is an example of a real world application of the String type to iOS application development.
 
 ![StoryboardID](./StoryboardID.png)
 
 ```
 @IBAction func buttonPressed(sender: AnyObject) {
 let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier("MyViewController") as MyCustomViewController
 presentViewController(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
 }
 ```

 */
var string: String

// write code here 


/*:

 # DEMO (15 mins)
 
 * Iterate through the String using a for loop.
 
 * Iterate through the String using index
 
 * Solve the opening problem
 
 * Splitting Strings

//ITERATE USING FOR LOOP
//=====================

//ITERATE USING INDEX
//=====================

//=====================
//SPLITTING STRINGS
//=====================

// You split strings using any character

 # PAIR-PROGRAMMING PRACTICE (15 mins)
 
 ## PRACTICE PROBLEMS
 
 * Takes a String representing a sentence and returns a String with the words (not the characters) reversed
 
 * Takes a String and prints it in all upper case
 
 * Write  a function that takes a String and returns a new String with all instances of the Character â€˜aâ€™ with the character â€˜oâ€™.
 
 * Write a function that prints all of the Unicode characters (advanced)

 # CONCLUSION (5 mins)
 
 ## CHECK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING: WRITE-SHARE
 
 *Write down what you think is the purpose of a String type.*
 
 ## TAKEAWAYS
 
 * The structure reference for a String type reveals a `struct` with definite methods & properties for its manipulation as a data types; the String type is an Array of characters.
 
 * Most of what your users communicate to you will be through Strings: passwords, emails, numbers, names, etc.
