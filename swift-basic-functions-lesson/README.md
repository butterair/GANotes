## CONNECTION TO LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE

Functions are a fundamental programming concept that allow for greater organization of thought and code.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

* **Identify** the purpose of a function
* **Identify** the different parts of a function
* **Write** functions that accept parameters and return values
* **Call** a function

## STUDENT PRE-WORK

Students should be able to:

* Write loops
* Create Playgrounds in Xcode
* Declare and use variables

## OPENING: WHY FUNCTIONS (10 mins)

Show students a playgrounds file with a lot of duplicated code.

For example, write some code to download images.

### THINK-PAIR-SHARE

*"What kind of problems do you foresee if we keep writing code this way?"*

---


## INTRODUCTION: FUNCTIONS (15 mins)

### DEFINITION

"Functions are self-contained *chunks *of code that perform a specific task."

* Swift Reference

### STOP AND JOT

Think of an analogy for a function. 

### ANALOGIES

* **Beer Brewing:** You put ingredients in, some process happens, and it results in beer. An important idea with functions is that *if you put in the same ingredients, you should get the same beer.*
* **Making Coffee:** Insert coffee and hot water, something happens, you get coffee.

### DEMONSTRATE

Write a function. Identify each component of the function definition:

Show the class 3-4 examples of functions.

Include different types of functions (no parameters, no return types, etc)

Show students how they would call the function.

## DEMO: WRITING FUNCTIONS (10 mins)

Solve the opening problem and write a function for it.

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING - PAIR-SHARE

How is this better than what we had before?

## GUIDED PRACTICE: TELL ME WHAT TO DO (15 mins)

Start with a coding problem: Code that duplicates functionality. 

A good example might be: 

Write a function that takes an Emoji and returns the word for that emoji. 

### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Have the students get up and write a function on the whiteboards or on the desks:

*Write a function that takes 3 integers and returns their average.*

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE: WRITING FUNCTIONS (20 mins)

### PRACTICE PROBLEMS

Write a function that

* Prints "hello {name}"
* Takes 4 numbers and returns their product
* Takes an integer and determines whether it is a [perfect square](https://www.easycalculation.com/square-roots-perfect-numbers.html).
* Takes an integer and determines if it is a [perfect number.](http://exercism.io/exercises/swift/perfect-numbers/readme)

## CONCLUSION (5 mins)

### CHECK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING: WRITE-SHARE

*Write down what you think is the purpose of a function.*

### TAKEAWAYS

* Functions help write cleaner and more organized code
* Functions help reduce code duplication by allowing you to reuse functionality

### BEST PRACTICES

* Write descriptive function names using verby words
* Name your parameters well and clearly
* Functions should conceptually do one thing
* Check your shit(arguments) at the door
* Keep it tight; functions should not be more than 100 lines long
* Keep functions at their level
