# Week 1: Weekend Material 

Weekend Reading is like a bridge from this week's material to the next. Since this week is all about getting comfortable in Xcode and Swift, learning about the basics of Auto Layout, Constraints, & Visual Format Language is a great way to fill the gap for Interface Builder (i.e., IB).

<!--
#### Weekly Instructor Prep

- Be sure to have your curriculum repository and GA organization set up
- Set up a form for the [reflection session](../recurring-materials/reflection) that can be shared and used by 
-->
#### Topics (Bolded Below)

- Auto Layout
- Constraints
- Visual Format Language

---

1) Please cover each & every one of the topics in [Apple's Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/), including but not limited to Getting Started, Auto Layout Cookbook, Debugging Auto Layout, Advanced Auto Layout, & Appendix, as well as Revision History. 

2) Please watch [Apple's 2012 Introduction to Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2012/202/). Although outdated, the video provides an excellent overview of the constraint based system that supplements the documentation. 

3) [What's New in Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/236/)

4) [Mysteries of Auto Layout 1](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/218/)

5) [Mysteries of Auto Layout 2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/219/)

6) [Taking Control of Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2013/406/)

7) [Visual Format Language Reference Guide](http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2013/01/31/visual-format-language-for-autolayout/)

8) [Visual Format Language Reference Guide](https://www.raywenderlich.com/110393/auto-layout-visual-format-language-tutorial)

Bonus 

9) Apple's tutorial _Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)_ is an invaluable project that reviews everything covered in Week I and prepares for Week II. The tutorial is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/); if you would like, build the project pushing code to a seperate folder in your GitHub account. 

10) If you would like to practice advanced topics like intrinsic content sizes, the alignment rect, animation or debugging, then objc.io's [Advanced Auto Layout Toolbox](http://www.objc.io/issues/3-views/advanced-auto-layout-toolbox/) on Auto Layout is an excellent resource. 

11) If you would like to practice other advanced topics like adapative layouts or size classes, (i.e., [Vango's](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vango-art-buy-original-art/id669344577?mt=8) app has an excellent example of size classes), then Tyler Fox's [Adaptive Auto Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taWaW2GzfCI#t=206) is an excellent resource. 

12) These classics on iOS application development are well known throughout the community: [Stanford's iOS 8 Apps with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099)

#### WWDC

A great resource for deepening knowledge of Swift, Xcode, & iOS is WWDC - Apple's World Wide Developers' Conference app. You can download the app here: [WWDC app] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwdc/id640199958?mt=8)

Either as a group or as individuals let's plan to submit an application to attend WWDC 2017. 

The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2017 takes place June 5-9 in San Jose, California. 

Registration opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. 

To register, we would need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. [Here](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) is the link to sign up.
