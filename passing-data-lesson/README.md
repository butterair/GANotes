## STUDENT PRE-WORK

Students should be able to:

* Write Functions and Classes

* Link Design & Code using Interface Builder

# OPENING (10 mins)

## ACTIVITY: CLASS POEM (2 mins)

In this activity, each student in the class adds one line to the poem, and passes it on. 

Read the poem to the class at the end of it.

This conveys the idea of passing it down.

It might be a good idea to divide it into teams of 3 

### Opening Line

"The mask was slipped deftly over her face"

## LECTURE

Show them the concept of Passing Data visually

## DEMO

Show the students a finished app that uses custom table views and two segues where data is passed.

# PRACTICE: SETUP YOUR PROJECT (15 mins)

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE

* Create a new Project

* Create your Table View Controller and Table View

* Set up a basic Table View listing five of your favorite shows/people/places.

* Get an image for each one

* Run it in the Simulator to verify

---


# WE-DO: PASSING DATA (15 mins)

During this guided practice section, show the students step-by-step pass data through a segue from one ViewController onto another.

* Create the Data Structure

* Create the Second View Controller

* Layout the Second Scene (add image, title, etc)

* Create the Segue

* Pass the Data 

# PRACTICE: COMPLETE THE APP (20 mins)

# INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE

* Ensure each cell has a fully populated scene with an image

# CONCLUSION (5 mins)

TAKEAWAYS

* Passing Data allows you to separate *what* you show from *how* you show it.
