# CONNECTION TO LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE

Inheritance is one of the basic Object-Oriented Programming Principles. It is used extensively in the iOS SDK. For example, a UIButton extends a UIView. That means a Button is a View. All the drawing and graphics code in the UIView class is inherited by the UIButton and does not need to be re-written.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

* **Articulate** the purpose of Inheritance

* **Design** a hierarchy of Classes

* **Use** inheritance

## INSTRUCTOR PREP

* Read through the [Swift Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Inheritance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH17-ID193)

* Take a look at the [lab](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iOSI-course-materials/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-02/baseline-materials/inheritance-lab)

* Open the starter code

## STUDENT PRE-WORK

Students should be able to:

* Design and create classes

* Write functions

# OPENING (10 mins)

## PRACTICE PROBLEM

Create the following classes:

* Vehicle

* Car

* Truck

* Sedan

* Coupe

* Ferrari

* SUV

* Sports Car

Add the following methods to each class.

* accelerate()

* brake()

* honk()

# INTRODUCTION: INHERITANCE (10 mins)

## WHO CARES

Object-Oriented Programming was one of the revolutionary concepts in the field during the 90s. One of its key principles is inheritance, which allowed developers to get more bang for their clicks. Inheritance saves you from having to write the same functionality over and over again.

## DEFINITION

A Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

Inheritance is the ability to create classes that inherit properties and behavior from another class.

## DEMONSTRATE

* Visually explain how Inheritance works

* Explain how 

---


# DEMO: USING INHERITANCE (5 mins)

## DEMONSTRATE

* How to make one class extend another

* How to instantiate an object of both

* How to check their types

---


# INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

* Complete the inheritance exercise

# DEMO: OVERRIDING FUNCTIONS (10 mins)

Let’s override the following function:

* accelerate()

# INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

Finish overriding the functions where it makes sense.

---


# CONCLUSION (5 mins)

## CHECK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING: WRITE-SHARE

Think of a subject where Inheritance makes sense, for example cars.

## TAKEAWAYS

* Inheritance is very commonly used in 

## BEST PRACTICES & TIPS

* Don’t overuse Inheritance.

* Use it only where it makes sense to do so. The relationship should be natural.

* You will use it in every app, but not in the way we did today.

    * But it is still important to understand the concept.
