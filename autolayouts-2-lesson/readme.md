# CONNECTION TO LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE

Passing Data allows you to cleanly separate what you are showing from how you are showing it.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

* **Apply** aspect-ratio constraints

* **Apply** Leading, Trailing, Bottom, and Top Spacing constraints

* **Apply** Horizontal Center, Vertical Center constraints

* **Align** views relative to each other

## INSTRUCTOR PREP

* Take a look at the [lab](https://github.com/ga-iosi-la/iOSI-course-materials-LA/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-04/baseline-materials/autolayouts-lab)

* Open the starter code

## STUDENT PRE-WORK

Students should be able to:

* Design Interfaces using Interface Builder

# OPENING DEMO (5 mins)

DEMO

Start the class by showing views that do not have Autolayouts. Run it on 2 differently-sized devices to show the discrepancy.

*Suggested Example: *A simple ViewController with a full screen ImageView

# INTRODUCTION: AUTOLAYOUT VOCABULARY (15 mins)

Explain the concepts and uses for the following terms:

* Constraints

* Aspect-Ratio

* Leading, Trailing, Bottom, Top Spacing

* Margin

* Horizontal Center, Vertical Center

* Align Leading, Trailing, Top, Bottom

* Width, Height

## CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING

Pair-Write: 

1. Show the students a view with a couple of elements on the screen

2. Ask students to describe what they see using Autolayouts Vocabulary

# GUIDED PRACTICE: USING AUTOLAYOUTS (10 mins)

Have the students follow along as you add a couple of views and use Autolayouts to lay them out.

* Add a full-screen image

* Make it take up the top half of the screen

* Run it on a device in Portrait and Landscape

# INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

* Add a second Image that takes up the bottom half of the screen

* Add a Label that is horizontally centered, 24 pts from the bottom

# GUIDED PRACTICE: USING AUTOLAYOUTS (15 mins)

Have the students follow along as you add a couple of views and use Autolayouts to lay them out.

* Create a new screen and add an Image

* Center the image Vertically and Horizontally

* Add a another view, centering it vertically and horizontally to the image

* Move the first View and update-frames, to demonstrate the effect of Autolayout

* Add another view that hangs from the bottom of the original view, horizontally centered to the original view

# INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (10 mins)

* Create a View with a series of 5 UITextFields laid out Vertically, Horizontally centered.

* Create a view with a profile picture

# CONCLUSION (5 mins)

TAKEAWAYS

* Autolayouts is a Language used to communicate your Appâ€™s Layout to the system
